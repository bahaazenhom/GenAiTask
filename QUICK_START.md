# Quick Start Guide

## What's Been Created

You now have **two complete QuickSort applications** with dramatically different user interfaces:

### 🎨 Task 2 - Professional Dashboard
**Location**: `Task 2/index.html`

**What it looks like**: Modern corporate dashboard with a sidebar menu and card-based layout. Think of apps like Notion, Linear, or modern admin panels.

**How to use**:
- Open `Task 2/index.html` in your browser
- Use the sidebar to navigate between sections
- Input data in the "📥 Input" section
- Select algorithm in "⚙️ Algorithm" section
- View results in "📊 Results"
- Run comparisons in "⏱️ Benchmark"

### 💻 Task 3 - Terminal Console
**Location**: `Task 3/index.html`

**What it looks like**: A developer terminal/command-line interface. Think VS Code terminal, iTerm2, or classic Unix terminal.

**How to use**:
- Open `Task 3/index.html` in your browser
- Type commands in the input at the bottom
- Or use the buttons in the sidebar
- Type `help` to see all available commands
- Choose verbosity level for output detail

## Testing Both Applications

### Quick Test Steps

1. **Open Task 2**:
   ```
   Open in browser: d:\C\GenAi Task\Task 2\index.html
   ```
   - Click "Generate Random"
   - Go to Algorithm section
   - Click "Sort Array"
   - Check Benchmark section

2. **Open Task 3**:
   ```
   Open in browser: d:\C\GenAi Task\Task 3\index.html
   ```
   - Type: `help`
   - Type: `generate`
   - Type: `sort recursive`
   - Type: `benchmark`

## File Structure

```
Task 2/                          Task 3/
├── index.html                   ├── index.html

└── quicksort.js                 └── quicksort.js
```

All files are complete and error-free! ✅

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Task 2 | Task 3 |
|--------|--------|
| 🎨 Dashboard UI | 💻 Terminal UI |
| Sidebar navigation | Command-line input |
| Blue/purple theme | Dark terminal theme |
| Button-based | Command or button-based |
| Fixed output format | Verbosity options |
| Professional look | Hacker/dev look |

## Next Steps

1. **Test both applications** by opening them in your browser
2. **Compare the UIs** to see how different they are
3. **Try all features** in both versions
4. **Run benchmarks** to compare algorithm performance

Both implementations are production-ready and fulfill the lab assignment requirements! 🚀
